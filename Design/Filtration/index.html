        <h1> Filtration Methods</h1><br><br>
        <img src="assets/img/filters.png" class="aligncenter">
        <p >
          The filtration system is responsible for keeping the water clear and free of particulate matter (tiny fragments of plant material, leftover food, feces, waste products from the fish, etc.) and toxic compounds that are dangerous to the inhabitants.
          As the degree of contamination rises, the risk to the health of the other increases and removal of the contamination becomes critical.
          Choosing the correct filtration system for your aquarium is an important decision that will impact not only the type and quantity of livestock that you wish to keep, but also the amount of maintenance that the system will require.
                 There are 3 types of Filtration methods.They are
         </p>
       </div>

    <p class="h2"><strong>1.Biological Filtration</strong></p>
<br><br>
      <img  src="assets/img/bio.jpg"  class="aligncenter" height="300" width="250">
    </a>
    <div id="demo">
      <p>
      In biological filtration, different types of bacteria convert the toxic chemical byproducts produced by the aquarium inhabitants into less toxic nutrients.
      This breakdown process by the bacteria is called the Nitrogen Cycle.</p>
      <p>
        In the Nitrogen Cycle, the waste products of the fish, plants, and invertebrates along with any dead organisms or uneaten food are broken down by bacteria and fungi into ammonia.
        Ammonia is extremely toxic to all of the aquarium inhabitants and is broken down into nitrites by an oxygen-loving bacteria known as Nitrosomonas.
        Although nitrites are not as toxic as ammonia, even at low concentrations in the aquarium, they can still be harmful to fish and invertebrates.
        Again, another bacteria called Nitrobacter, which also utilizes oxygen acts in a similar way as Nitrosomonas and essentially changes nitrites into relatively harmless nitrates.
        Nitrates at low to moderate levels will not harm most fish or invertebrates.</p>
        <p>
          For the Nitrogen Cycle to work properly, there must be an area for a sufficient number of these bacteria to grow and their need for oxygen must be met.
          The capacity of a biological filter is determined by the available surface area for bacterial growth and the oxygen content of the water passing over them.
          Not all filters have the same capacity when it comes to biological filtration.
         Filters in which the biological media is exposed to the air are going to have the greatest capacity.
      </p>
    </div>
 <br><p class="h2"><strong>2.Mechanical Filtration</strong></p>
 </a><br><br>
<img src="assets/img/mech.png" class="aligncenter">
 <p>Mechanical filtration is the process in which particulate matter is removed from the water.
   To accomplish this, the aquarium water is forced through a media (material) that is designed to catch and hold these tiny particles.
   This media is available in many forms including different types of foam, filter floss, pads, micron paper pleats, and diatomaceous earth.
   To function properly, it is important that this media is cleaned regularly to remove the particulate matter it has trapped, prior to the material decaying and adding to the waste products in the aquarium.<p/>
<p>
  It is a common misconception with many aquarists that by oversizing the mechanical filter, more fish can be kept in the system and the filter will require less maintenance.
  All mechanical filters over time will become clogged with particulate matter.
  When this occurs, it will cause the water flow to either decrease or flow around the material instead of through it.
  At that point, we should recognize the need to clean the filter.
  By oversizing the mechanical filter, it may be months before the filter loses its efficiency which means that it will be months between cleanings.
  Even though the aquarium may look clean and free of particulate matter, the filter will be holding large amounts of detritus (tiny pieces of decomposing plant or animal material) and other debris that is slowly decaying and contaminating the water with toxic breakdown products such as ammonia, nitrites, and ultimately nitrates.
  These waste products, therefore, actually reduce the number of aquarium inhabitants that can be housed safely.</p>

<br><p class="h2"><strong>3.Chemical Filtration</strong></p><br><br>
<img src="assets/img/chem.jpg" class="aligncenter">
  <p>Chemical filtration removes toxins that cannot be removed by biological and mechanical filtration media.
    Chemical filter media work at the chemical level to remove toxins that readily pass through your biological and mechanical filters.
    Chemical filtration is a must for clean, clear, pure, and pollutant-free aquarium water.is the simplest way to remove these potentially dangerous pollutants from fresh and saltwater systems.
    There are a variety of chemical filter media available.
    Most chemical media remove specific pollutants from the water column while others are combined to create multi-functional chemical filter media that simplify removal of multiple pollutants
    Check out which chemical media type best suits your aquarium's filtration needs for improved water quality.</p>
<br><p class="h3"><strong>Activated Carbon</strong></p><br>
<img src="assets/img/carbon.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="300" width="250"><br><p>
Carbon is by far the most popular form of chemical filter media.
It boasts a myriad of microscopic pores that bind with and remove dissolved particles from your aquarium's water.
Activated carbon helps remove a variety of pollutants including copper, chlorine, dissolved proteins, medications, and other organic and inorganic compounds.
It also removes odors and discoloration to create crystal clear aquarium water.
Since carbon loses its effectiveness as its pores fill, be sure to replace it frequently for optimal chemical filtration.</p>
<br><p class="h3"><strong>Zeolites</strong></p><br>
<img src="assets/img/zeolite.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="300" width="250"><br><p>
Zeolites is a mineral-based media with porous composition.
It differs from other chemical filter media in that it specifically absorbs and removes ammonia and other nitrogenous compounds from freshwater aquariums.
Many forms of zeolite can rapidly reduce large concentrations of ammonia from the water column.
Some forms can also be soaked in saltwater to recharge their absorptive abilities for reuse within your aquarium filter.
It is available in both natural and synthetic forms.
While primarily used for freshwater applications, special zeolite media is also available for marine aquariums.</p>
<br><p class="h3"><strong>Phosphate Removers</strong></p><br>
<img src="assets/img/phosphate.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="300" width="250"><br><p>
This form of chemical filter media is also highly porous and super absorbent.
It effectively binds large concentrations of phosphate, dissolved organic compounds, heavy metals, and other pollutants.
High phosphate levels reduce water clarity and feed undesirable organisms, such as nuisance algae.
In saltwater aquariums, phosphate can precipitate dissolved calcium and magnesium, vital for healthy coral growth.
Many phosphate removers are formulated for long-lasting control and have high saturation points to help prevent absorbed pollutants from leaching back into your aquariumâ€™s water.
Though many forms of phosphate removers are available, most preferred is ferric oxide hydroxide-based formulas.</p>
<br><p class="h3"><strong>Resins</strong></p><br>
<img src="assets/img/resins.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="300" width="250"><br><p>
Resins attract and remove specific water toxins via ion exchange.
Within this process, resins draw charged toxins such as ammonia from the water column and exchange them with less harmful compounds such as sodium.
They work in the same principle as zeolite and are also available in both natural and synthetic forms.
The greatest advantage of most resins is that oftentimes a single resin formula works to neutralize a variety of aquarium pollutants.
This multi-faceted chemical filter media is especially beneficial in existing filtration systems without room for multiple filter media or the capacity to expand.
Most resins remain highly active over long periods of time with little fluctuation in absorptive capabilities.
This makes resins suitable for use with more demanding fish and corals that thrive only in aquariums with high water quality.</p>
