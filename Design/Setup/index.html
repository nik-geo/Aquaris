    <h3><span>Setting Up An Aquarium</span></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="sub-heading">
    <p>
       STEPS:
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>
Step 1:
  </h2>
  <p>
Throughly wash aquarium gravel, rocks and ornaments with warm water, then add them to your tank.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not use soap or detergents—they are highly toxic to fish.<br>
    To wash the gravel, put it in a colander over a plastic pan or bucket and add water. Stir the gravel, drain, and repeat until the water stays clear and is free of debris.<br>
  </p>

  <h2>
Step 2:
  </h2>
  <p>
Fill your tank approximately one-third full with room temperature water from a clean bucket.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pouring the water onto a plate or saucer sitting on the gravel will help keep the gravel in place.<br>
    Add a water conditioner, like Tetra AquaSafe Solution, to de-chlorinate the water. Chlorine is fine for you, not your fish<br>
    </p>

  <h2>
Step 3:
  </h2>
  <p>
Connect the airline tubing from the air pump to any air outlets inside your tank, such as air stones or decorations.
  </p>
  <p>
By using an aquarium check valve, you can safely locate your air pump underneath your aquarium.<br> (A check value is a small valve that is placed in the air tubing outside of your tank. <br>It acts as a stop, preventing water from backing up and out of your aquarium if the power is turned off.<br>)
    </p>

  <h2>
Step 4:
  </h2>
  <p>
Aquascape with live and/or plastic plants.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ideally, these should be arranged to hide your equipment.<br>
    If you’re adding live plants, make sure the water is warm enough for them. Plant the roots gently below the surface of the gravel, leaving the crown (if the plant has one) exposed.<br>
    Remember to keep live plants moist until they’re planted—wet newspaper works well. <br>For optimum growth and root development, use an aquatic plant fertilizer such as Tetra® FloraPride® and the proper lighting.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>
  Step 5:
    </h2>
    <p>
  Add the rest of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
Fill your tank to the bottom of the top frame —leaving some air space between the water and the cover.
        </p>

      <h2>
    Step 6:
      </h2>
      <p>
    Plug in your air pump, power filter and heater and start them up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Important: Do not switch on the heater when it’s not immersed in water—the heating element can malfunction and overheat, and the glass tube can shatter if placed in water while hot.
Check the air outlets and adjust the settings.<br>
Make sure water is flowing properly through your power filter.<br>
Adjust the heater to the proper temperature. It will take 24 hours for the temp to stabilize and you may have to adjust your setting.<br>
Wait 24 hours to ensure all equipment is working properly before adding fish.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>
      Step 7:
        </h2>
        <p>
      Congratulations!
        </p>
        <p>
          Your new aquarium is fish-safe, fish-ready and fully equipped. <br>The final step? Introducing your new pets to their new home, which you can see how to do here.<br>

    <h1><span>DESIGNING OF AN AQUARIUM</span></h1>
    </div>
<img src="assets/img/design.png" class="aligncenter">
  <div class="sub-heading">
  <p >
      Designing your aquarium using aquascape is not rocket science. <br>Aquarius assists you in knowing some basic knowledge regarding certain things about all elements that make up an aquascape.
    </p>
  </div>
<h2>
  1. Research and plan for your aquascape
</h2>
<p >
  Before going into anything at the start, always research and plan for your aquascape first. This includes elements such as: the number of fishes, the type of plants and fishes, plant compatibility, steepness of slope, location for hardscapes (driftwoods and rocks), etc.<br>By researching and planning for your aquascape, everything else will be simplified afterwards and you will save a great deal of time.<br>Before you start, always plan for the layout of your aquascape and research the necessary materials that needs to be bought.
</p>

<h2>
  2. Decide where you will place your aquarium
</h2>
<p >
  Make sure you place your aquarium where you wanted it to be.<br> If you are not sure where you want to set up your aquascape, it is best not to start setting up the aquascape. The reason for this is that if you decide to move the aquarium after everything is placed in it, then you will most probably damage your aquarium, if not your back.<br>A fully aquascaped aquarium can easily weigh tens of kilograms without water. With additional water in the aquarium, the weight of the aquarium will increase significantly, becoming impossible for ordinary men to lift. <br> One liter of water equals to one kilogram in weight.
</p>

<h2>
  3. Place a pressure mat below your aquarium
</h2>
<p >
  Pressure mats are ordinary rubber sheets, which has the same dimensions as the base of your aquarium.<br>The purpose of a pressure mat is to even out the pressure at the bottom of the aquarium.<br>This pressure mat will reduce the stress the aquarium glass is taking at the bottom layer.
</p>

<h2>
    4. A Thin layer of substrate at the base of your aquarium
</h2>
<p >
      Lay out a thin layer of substrate at the base of your aquarium approximately 2 cm.<br>The purpose of this thin substrate layer is to provide a cushioning effect for other materials you are going to place on top.<br>Spread your base fertilizer in this step as well.
</p>

<h2>
  5. Position your large hardscapes
</h2>
<p >
  After laying out your substrate material, place your large hardscapes, i.e. rocks and driftwoods, that make up the backbone of your aquascape.
</p>

<h2>
  6. Add more substrate materials to create slopes or soil mounds
</h2>
<p >
  Add more substrate materials around your large rocks and driftwoods to create a sense of depth.
</p>

<h2>
  7. Place smaller hardscapes to complete the layout texture and add water
</h2>
<p >
  Place smaller rocks and driftwoods after soil mounding to complete your aquascape layout.<br>Add water to the aquarium to the quarter mark.<br>  Completing this step will make it easier for you to plant your plants.
</p>

<h2>
  8. Plant your plants from the foreground area to the back
</h2>
<p >
  It is generally easier to plant your plants from front to back. The reason for this is that there will be no tall stem plants to obstruct your planting hand.<br>This method of planting also enables you to check the positions of the lower plants since they are not obstructed by the taller plants at the back.
</p>

<h2>
  9. Set up filters, lighting fixtures, CO2 injection systems, etc.
</h2>
<p >
  Set up your aquarium accessories before filling up your tank with water. This will keep the floor around your aquarium dry.
</p>

<h2>
  10. Fill up your aquarium with water all the way up
</h2>
<p >
  Make sure you use dechlorinated water as chlorine is generally bad for your fishes and plants.<br>Start your aquarium filter after you are done filling your aquarium water.<br>You can also add fishes in small amounts at a time after a few days.
</p>

<h2>
  11. Do at least 50% water changes every day or 2 days for the first 6-8 weeks
</h2>
<p >
  After your aquascape is finished, the bacteria culture that decomposes excess organic wastes is not yet established. It is your job to keep excessive organic wastes in control by means of water changes. You should be changing at least 50% of the water in your aquarium every day or every 2 days.
</p>

<h2>
  12. Watch for algae that starts to appear in your aquascape
</h2>
<p >
   Certain types of algae, such as green spot algae and green filamentous algae, are natural indicators of your aquarium water. If good algae are growing in your aquascape, this means that your aquarium water is extremely habitable and is the perfect host for aquatic lifeforms.
 </p>

 <h2>
   13. Add Siamese Algae Eaters and Amano Shrimps after the first signs of algae
</h2>
<p >
  Adding algae cleanup crew is the surest method to keep your algae growth at a controllable rate.<br>Give no chance for the algae to take over by adding these two most dilligent algae crew.<br>If Siamese algae eaters or Amano shrimps are too expensive for you, you can also use red cherry shrimps, which are generally cheaper in large numbers to help with algae cleanup.
</p>

<h2>
14. After three months, add liquid fertilizers every day in small dosages.
</h2>
<p>
  Generally start by applying liquid fertilizers after three months. Liquid fertilizers helps to create beautiful and healthy plants since nutrients tend to be depleted by the third month.
