            Beautiful, mesmerizing and always attractive fish aquariums have very high importance in vastu shastra.<br>The reason for such a high level of importance is attributed to the fact that a fish aquarium in vastu acts as rectification for many vastu defects.
              <br>We know that all things in this universe have certain level of energy associated with them.<br>If we locate everything at correct place then the energy they dissipate is harmonious for us.<br>The same logic also applies to fish aquariums in vastu shastra.
              <br>When placed and used correctly, a fish aquarium becomes master-key for success and harmony, but if used incorrectly the same fish aquarium becomes happiness ruining element

Feng shui aquariums are a beautiful and potent feng shui cure  to attract the energy of wealth and abundance. Placed right, and taken care of wisely, they will amplify the energy in any home or office and attract more Wealth
In feng shui terms, moving water brings prosperity and good luck to the home. Water fountains and aquariums are great feng shui enhancements because they are at the same time soothing and energizing. The sound and motion of gurgling water activates chi and adds humidity to a dry room, helping to balance chi. Moving water gets things going when the chi has been stagnant for a while (think of ice melting in the spring). Use moving water cures anywhere you want to enhance water or wood energy.  Aquariums are beneficial to place in the North, East and North-East of living room. The faults related to north-west corner can be corrected by putting an aquarium.

              <b><a href="../Types of Fishes/fresh water fishes/Silverarowana.html">Arowana</a></b> are rare and noble fish that bear a close resemblance to the traditional Dragon of Ancient china.<br>
              It is believed to be auspicious and symbolises strength, prosperity, luck and wealth - and provides any aquarist with good Feng Shui.<br>
              These fish have a life span in excess of 20 years, and are a beautiful investment for the perfect tank.<br>
              The Asian Arowana is considered auspicious by many, as well as being a symbol of wealth and stature. They embody several Feng Sui concepts of the Dragon complemented by Water bringing luck and tranquillity to the owner.

The Dragon Fish in Feng Sui
The Fish itself has a number of characteristics that fit within the principals of Feng Sui. The large scales and their colouring of Red or Golden demonstrate the existence of wealth and success. Being such a noble and dominant fish it also presents the character of strength and success which can be reflected on the owner. The large mouth that only collects food from the surface show how the fish can engulf success from above and draw it in for the owner.

Water is a place where chi gathers, it is naturally a source of yin energy containing an "auspicious" fish such as an Arowana e balances the yang and helps to dispel any negative energy in the household or office.

                    <a href="../Types of Fishes/fresh water fishes/Flowerhorn.html"><img src="assets/img/Flower Horn.png" class="aligncenter"></a>
                  <p style="font-size:20px;" class="aligncenter">
                    The Flower Horn fish is considered by the Chinese as the most auspicious fish that is developed by aquarists to date (much to the frowns of many Western purists). Its every characteristic is somehow related to prosperity, health and wealth, to the owners of the fish, of course! The nuchal hump, the colour, the aggression, the so-called "pearls", etc is much sought after.
                    <br>Forehead:
                    The forehead or "Nuchal Hump" of the Flower Horn fish is the main focus of attraction of the Flower Horn fish and is much sought after. <br>After all, the main reason (among others) that this fish is so popular is because of its unique feature: the head!<br>
                    A fully developed forehead, which is round and tender, is a symbol of luck, prosperity, longevity and happiness. It enhances the glory of its owner.<br>A huge and beautiful forehead that harmonizes with its body qualifies it to be a fish of choice.<br>
                    Some even believe that as the head grows bigger and bigger, so does the level of prosperity to the owner! A fully developed forehead decorated with evenly spread red spots is more preferred.<br> Such a forehead is called "li-zhi" forehead resembling the auspiscious Chinese fruit : Lychee!<br>
                    The colour on the fish should be naturally pleasing yet intense enough to generate excitement.<br> The more varied and intense the colours, the more outstanding the fish will be. The base colour of the fish should not be pale and dull.<br>
                    Nowadays, the Flower Horn fish possess lots of shimmering/luminiscent scales or so-called "pearls".<br>
                    The Flower Horn fish is an aggressive and territorial type of fish and will chase away any intruder to its territory. <br>Because of this nature, early owners of the fish started "playing" with their fishes by training their pet to follow their hands.<br> This is done by gently swaying the hands OUTSIDE the tank and letting the fish follow the fingers. <br>If this is done correctly, the fish can be trained to do "loop-the-loop" or "topsy-turvy"!<br>
A healthy fish will naturally chase away any intruders to its territory and the more active the fish is, the more interesting it is to "play with it", thus the more form or responsiveness.
